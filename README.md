## Regenerative Prediction of Embryonic Cells
Contrubitors: Tony Yang (@tyang27), Ryan Lu (@ryanlu41), Nick Garza (@nickgarza)

In this project, we undertake the task of classifying immature cell types in order to predict their final cell growth phenotype. The implications for this project would be used for post traumatic infarction therapy in patients. In regenerative medicine, it is important for cell growth to be characterized at an immature state based on features of the data.

To classify our data, we utilized unsupervised and supervised learning methods to get accurate prediction groups for different cell data types. For validation of our findings, we used the Davies-Bouldin Index.
