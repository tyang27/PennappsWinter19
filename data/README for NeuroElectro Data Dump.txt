Contents:

1. neurophysiology_data.xlsx
	Description: Excel file containing the intrinsic electrophysiology data represented in the neuroelectro database. Each row corresponds to a reporting of a neuron type within an article and its reported intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Properties which are not observed are encoded with NaN. Article-level experimental and publication metadata are listed on same rows, as well as links to data on neuroelectro website. Nominal metadata fields which are not observed are encoded with blank characters and ordinal values are encoded with NaN.

2. neuron_description.xlsx
	Description: Excel file containing listing of neuron types reflected in NeuroElectro. Includes information used to curate specific neuron mentions as well as NeuroLex identifiers.

3. ephys_description.xlsx
	Description: Excel file containing listing of electrophysiological properties indexed in NeuroElectro. Includes defining information for each property as well as specific normalization and curation guidelines. Note the differing normalization and curation quality across specific properties - due to the inherent variability in how specific properties are calculated and reported in the literature.

4. metadata_description.xlsx
	Description: Excel file containing listing of experimental metadata properties as well as information about how these properties were algorithmically extracted. Note that manual curation followed algorithmic extraction of properties.
